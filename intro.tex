Hey, you! Yes, you. Person holding this book plus associated team members. Pay attention!

You are probably better off putting me down and walking away slowly, but if you insist on proceeding, you should at least follow some basic guidelines.

Don't stray from the path. If you get lost, you can always go back to page 1.

Speaking of lost, it appears that none of you thought to bring an atlas, so you'll need to use the maps in \textbf{Appendix A} to orient yourself to the ``real world.'' I've included all of the locations you'll visit today along with several of my personal favorites.

I can't explain everything right now, but if you follow the instructions and \textbf{STICK TO THE PATH}, you'll probably be fine. You did all sign that waiver, right? Good.

If you're all sure you're up to this, go ahead and turn the page.
